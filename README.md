# RESTful API in datascience
This is an introduction to implementing RESTful APIs using python Flask. A basic model for Iris dataset, which is a very famous dataset, will be trained and used here as well.

## Introduction
A few software development talents function as floodgates, keeping a tremendous ocean of possibility at bay.
When you learn one of these talents, it's as if a whole new universe opens up in front of you. 

Here I am using one these skills. An API is the ability to build code that can be deployed online and communicated with. 

Building a deployable API requires a number of sub-skills, which we will go through as we put our API together.
Nonetheless, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is mastery (or even proficiency), so this isn't a five-minute guide to becoming a hero. 

Here I will:
* Build an API with `Flask`
* Package my app with `Docker`
* Deploy with `Google cloud platform`
